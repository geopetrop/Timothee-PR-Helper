# Challenge Brief

## Build the best "Timmy vs. Opera/Ballet" crisis-response agent

Build a crisis-response agent for a fast-moving celebrity backlash. The job is to assess risk, route work across stakeholders, produce aligned communications, and update the plan when pressure increases.

This is not a statement-writing contest. We score judgment, sequencing, coordination, and workflow evidence.

## North Star

This challenge is designed to:
- require a real agentic workflow
- allow different solution styles
- make bluffing harder than in a one-shot writing task
- show decisions, approvals, and revisions in action
- reward process quality, not polished copy alone
- stay small enough for a focused build over about 50 hours

## Why this scenario works

This challenge uses a controlled version of the Timothée Chalamet ballet/opera backlash. In public coverage, that issue moved from a clipped quote into arts-community criticism, meme amplification, institution responses, and awards-night commentary.

The scenario combines incomplete context, rapid spread across social platforms, sponsor risk, and hard timing constraints. Timmy is a high-visibility actor with a polished public image and a large online audience. Because the quote is about ballet and opera, the backlash spreads beyond celebrity coverage into culture and institution accounts. That makes the story harder to contain and raises sponsor and press pressure.

## Scenario structure

All entrants receive the same two packets.

### Packet A — The clip breaks
**Scenario time:** 5:30 PM  
A 22-second clip is spreading. Reporter, sponsor, and management messages arrive. Timmy is off-phone until 6:05 PM. A sponsor-safe holding line is needed by 5:50 PM.

### Packet B — Sponsor escalation
**Scenario time:** 6:15 PM  
No new facts appear about the clip. The sponsor escalates internally and may pause all brand activity unless a credible plan arrives by 6:35 PM.

Packet B is included from the start for fairness. In scenario time, it happens later. Complete Phase 1 before you handle Packet B.

## What entrants must do

Build a workflow that can:
- assess crisis severity
- decide whether to speak or hold comment
- handle sponsor, reporter, management, and public response together
- sequence the next 30 to 60 minutes of actions
- revise the plan when Packet B arrives

## Rules for using the scenario

- Use only packet facts for scenario claims.
- Treat manager comments as internal context unless the packet verifies them.
- Do not invent missing transcript context.
- Do not assume legal review, full interview access, or outside evidence.
- Respect every stated approval limit and deadline.
- Complete Phase 1 before Packet B.
- Phase 2 must update Phase 1. Do not restart from scratch.
- Clearly label Phase 1 and Phase 2.
- Include one sentence stating that Phase 2 was produced after Phase 1.

## Valid builds

You do not need a full production app. Valid entries can be code-based, no-code, notebook-based, prompt/config-based, or structured workflow specs. Small builds are valid if the operating logic is clear. No app, deployment, or demo video is required.

## Submission requirements

Submit:
1. a public GitHub repo
2. the official submission form with team name, contact email, repo URL, and final commit SHA

The final commit SHA is the version we judge.

Your repo must include:
- one main submission file
- one standalone first-hour triage table artifact
- a short workflow overview or README
- any optional support files needed to understand how the build works

## Required outputs

The main submission file must include:

### Phase 1
- crisis severity with a short reason
- public response or a decision to hold comment, with a short reason
- reporter reply
- sponsor reply, including a sponsor-safe holding line of 40 words or fewer
- awards-night contingency plan
- three red flags

### Phase 2
- what changed
- what stays the same
- revised next 30 minutes
- revised sponsor reply
- one sentence on whether the public-response timing changes

### Workflow evidence
- workflow proof block
- raw-to-final reporter reply pair
- human edit disclosure

The separate triage table must include:
- stakeholder
- priority
- next action
- owner
- approval needed
- due by

## How we judge entries

- **Crisis judgment, triage, and sequencing — 40%**
- **Cross-stakeholder coordination — 20%**
- **Adaptation to new information — 25%**
- **Agent/workflow credibility — 15%**

High-scoring entries show clear triage, sensible restraint, strong approval logic, aligned outputs, and a workflow another operator could run again.
